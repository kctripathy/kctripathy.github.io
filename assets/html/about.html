                Once in a blue moon day, on <span class="kt-highlight">10th August 1975</span> (Srabana Sukla Chaturthi), I born from Late Sri Ramakant Tripathy and Smt. Subasini Tripathy, in the village <span class="kt-highlight">Lunipada</span>. I have two brothers and four sisters. Currently living in Bangalore with my wife and a son.
            </p>
            <p>
                My father was a <span class="kt-highlight">Kabiraj</span> (Ayurvedic Doctor) and also working as a state government employee. So, we used to roam with his place of employment. So, till class five I was studying in <span class="kt-highlight">Tumudibanda</span>, Khandhamal and on 1984 we shifted permanently to our native village <span class="kt-highlight">BD Pur (sasan)</span>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My village, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijayadhanurjayapur" target="_blank">
                  Bijaya Dhanurjayapur - Sasan</a>, Ganjam (Odisha) is surrounded by hill, green thus a deep inspiration for plantation,
              <span class="kt-highlight">folk-art</span>, tradition, and the
              power of technology to transform lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I’ve cultivated a unique path that merges two
              passions — software development and the soulful melodies of the
              Indian classical music using
              <span class="kt-highlight">bamboo flute (bansuri)</span> and
              <span class="kt-highlight">harmonium</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Here is below a cover song - <span class="kt-highlight">Mere Naina Sawan Bhado.....</span> (based on Raaga <span class="kt-highlight">Shivaranjani</span>), I tried to play in flute:</p>
