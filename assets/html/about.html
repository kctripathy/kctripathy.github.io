        I am software developer by profession and a musician at heart. I work with modern web technologies like Angular and .NET, and also create flute-based Indian classical music content on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@kctripathy" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> Channel.

        On <span class="kt-highlight">10th August 1975</span> (Srabana Sukla
        Chaturthi), I born from Late Sri Ramakant Tripathy and Smt. Subasini
        Tripathy, in the village <span class="kt-highlight">Lunipada</span>. I
        have two brothers and four sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
        My father was a <span class="kt-highlight">Kabiraj</span> (Ayurvedic
        Doctor) and also working as a state government employee. So, we used to
        roam with his place of employment. So, till class five I was studying in
        <span class="kt-highlight">Tumudibanda</span>, Khandhamal and on 1984 we
        shifted permanently to our native village
        <span class="kt-highlight">BD Pur (sasan)</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My native village,

          target="_blank"
        >
          Bijaya Dhanurjayapur - Sasan</a
        >, Ganjam (Odisha) is surrounded by hill, green thus a deep inspiration
        for plantation, <span class="kt-highlight">folk-art</span>, tradition,
        and the power of technology to transform lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve cultivated a unique path that merges two passions —
        software development and the soulful melodies of the Indian classical
        music using
        <span class="kt-highlight">bamboo flute (bansuri)</span> and
        <span class="kt-highlight">harmonium</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to live a simple life and believe in making a positive impact
        with everything I do. Whether it's through the lines of
        <span class="kt-highlight">Code</span>, the melodies of the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute#Indian"
          class="kt-highlight"
          target="_blank"
          >Indian Bamboo Flute</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_harmonium"
          target="_blank"
          class="kt-highlight"
          >Harmonium</a
        >, <span class="kt-highlight">Keyboard (CASIO)</span>, sharing
        knowledge, etc...
      </p>
      <p>Here is below a cover song - <span class="kt-highlight">Mere Naina Sawan Bhado.....</span> (based on Raaga <span class="kt-highlight">Shivaranjani</span>), I tried to play in flute:</p>
